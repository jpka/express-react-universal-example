# Instructions

## Installation

- `npm install` or `yarn`
- Configure MongoDB connection URI in `.env` to local or remote installation
- Check `data/initial-seed` for data to be seeded, check users for login credentials
- `npm run prepare` or `yarn prepare` (will seed the db)

## Running

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the project in development mode.  
You can view the application at `http://localhost:3000`

The page will reload if you make edits.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the build folder.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

### `npm run start:prod` or `yarn start:prod`

Runs the compiled app in production.

You can again view the application at `http://localhost:3000`

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Runs the test watcher (Jest) in an interactive mode.
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

### `npm start -- --inspect` or `yarn start -- --inspect`

To debug the node server, you can use `razzle start --inspect`. This will start the node server and enable the inspector agent. For more information, see [this](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector/).

### `npm start -- --inspect-brk` or `yarn start -- --inspect-brk`

To debug the node server, you can use `razzle start --inspect-brk`. This will start the node server, enable the inspector agent and Break before user code starts. For more information, see [this](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector/).

### `rs`

If your application is running, and you need to manually restart your server, you do not need to completely kill and rebundle your application. Instead you can just type `rs` and press enter in terminal.
